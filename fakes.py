"""Scripted LLM for offline runs and tests (Phase 1).

ScriptedLLM returns canned JSON per node id. A script value may be:
  - str: returned every call
  - list[str]: consumed in order (then last repeats)
  - callable(prompt, n): n = number of prior calls to that node id

make_rebuild_script() produces a coherent ChatGPT-visibility rebuild. With
poison_first_pass the section drafter emits "nine AI engines" on its first call
(caught by fact_diff at c19, routing back to L3) and the correct value after —
exercising the route-back loop. poison_always never corrects, forcing escalation.
